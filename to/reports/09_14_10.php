<h4>Current Stats:</h4>
<p><strong>Active Courses:</strong></p>

<li>CSMA - 29</li>
<li>DGA - 11</li>
</ul>

<p>It has been a major task to get training back up and functional since the switch in late July.  I have personally gone through every set of active course notes and exams (95) in all of the academies and made the edits to restore function, add content and add a few graphics.  I have done the same for most of the inactive courses as well in preparation for re-activation.  I have also point totaled evey exam and updated the course descriptions.  I have edited the new "About" areas under each academy and added graphics.  I have taken a few courses to ensure functionality of the system.  Working with the IO to fix bugs has also been a major time consumer.  Auto-responders still are not where they need to be so I must keep a close eye on all training aspects.  The EHTM was revised yesterday, more tweaks (Recruitment Manual), as was the Office of the TO.  The search for qualified and willing members to become course professors is continuous.  For more in-depth details of what the TO has been doing, please refer to the EH Meeting logs on the message boards, my posts on the message boards and my office site.</p>

<p>Current plans include overseeing training, followed by recoding a Small Arms course Tuba created for the CSMA since there isn't a Commander of Training at this moment and I am covering the slot.  I have come up with a basic outline for centralized training which is currently being tweaked by members of my office.</p>

<p>Future plans include to continue striving toward centralized training and getting alot of the content from old courses I have gathered up into the new training sytem somehow.  Another goal is to update and re-activate alot of the inactive courses.  IE: Trillian, maybe even AIM and ICQ.
Some of these tasks will be delegated to my CA and assistants.</p>

<p>I think it goes without saying that I have been covering many jobs instead of simply overseeing training in the EH.  I am leaving recruitment up to the groups to handle since retention is difficult to maintain without the groups offering any activities. I have provided them with an outline and some basic tools for recruitment in the EHTM revision.  Also, "New Member" announcements will be up to the groups to include in their news, reports, EH Meeting announcements or in newsletter submissions from now on.</p> 

<p>In service,</p>
