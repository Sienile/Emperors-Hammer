<ul>
	<li>Short-stories</li>
	<li>Poetry</li>
	<li>Run-on stories on the message boards</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trivia</strong><br />
Your Star Wars and EH knowledge will be measured in these events, which can be administerd via e-mail, message board or IRC.</p>

<p><strong>Webpage Design and Creation</strong><br />
Events, competitions, units and other situations all require webpages for effective communication within the Fleet. Webpages creation is a good way to get noticed and promote your own fighting unit.</p>

<p><strong>Graphics and other Artistic Endeavors</strong><br />
Creating original EH-oriented graphics is a great way to contribute to the Fleet. It does not matter if you think you are the worst artist in the world, there is never enough graphic art in the EH.</p>

<p><strong>Newsletters</strong><br />
The Emperor's Hammer publishes the Dark Sentinel. This newsletter covers the entire EH and accepts contributions from all corners of the club. Give your work a broader audience. Be creative!</p>

<h4>Events</h4>
<p><strong>Operations and Competitions</strong><br />
All of the above activities can be done as an individual effort at any time. Don't wait for some "official" event to come along to be active! When official events do come along, it is always a big event. Official events fall into two categories:<br />
Operations and Competitions.</p>

<p>Operations are the Big Events. They are always Group-wide and frequently have many different activities to encourage everyone to participate. Because they are so complex, they involve many man-hours of preparation and do not occur more than once every few months.</p>

<p>Competitions are more local events. They are usually at the unit level or below, pitting squadron against squadron or platoon against platoon. Inter-squad competitions can settle who is the best flight in a squadron or squad in a platoon. Competitions may be run by anyone and only require approval by a superior and the Operation Officer for that Group.</p>
