              <h3>Emperor's Hammer Central Academy</h3>
              <p>The EHCA -- Emperor's Hammer Central Academy -- is the main training facility for the Fleet. It's purpose is to provide a way for further developing your fictional persona as an imperial. The EHCA houses all kinds of courses and exams members can take, from the Group CORE exams to basic HTML understanding.</p>
              <p>The             CSMA -- Carrida Stormtrooper Military Academy -- is our subgroup's          "school." Its purpose is to provide a way for further          developing your fictional persona as a stormtrooper. The CSMA houses all the courses and exams          members must take at certain             points in their careers, and dozens of optional courses for earning Special Certifications             and other certifications.</p>
              <p>The Emperor's Hammer IWATS (Imperial Weapons and Tactics School) is a          similar "school" open to all EH members. The biggest          difference between the CSMA and IWATS is that IWATS offers courses that          teaches you real world skills such as building webpages and using IRC          clients for our online chatrooms, whereas CSMA offers fictional course          that "teach" you combat tactics, how to pilot an AT-ST, and          the parts of a stormtrooper's armor.</p>
              <p>Only          four courses are mandatory for reaching the upper limits of rank and             position:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>SSBTC (Standard Stormtrooper Basic Training Course), which             gives the right for a trooper to wear the =S= ribbon and progress in position in the Hammer's Fist.</li>
                <li>SSITC (Standard Stormtrooper             Intermediate Training Course), which bestows the =SS= ribbon and is a              stepping stone to an officer rank.</li>
                <li>IOTC (Imperial              Officer Training Course) for gaining the =SSS= ribbon. The =SSS= is              required to hold an officer posting.</li>
                <li>ICSC (Imperial              Command and Staff College), which grants the wearing of the =CS=              ribbon and the possibility of rising to the position of company              commander and higher.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The IIC and IIC/2 courses required by some ranks and positions are taken             through the Emperor's Hammer IWATS entity.</p>
              <p>For             a listing of current CSMA courses, visit the CSMA website. It's URL is             found through the EH and HF domain sites. The CSMA welcomes ideas for             new courses! If you have an idea, present it to the CT.             Anyone who works on and finishes a new course gets certification in             that course automatically.</p>

              <p>All Hammer's Fist             members are considered to have completed the below training before          joining the Hammer's Fist. Consider it merely background information          covering what it took for you to become an elite stormtrooper of the HF.</p>
              <p>I. Recruitment:             accomplished by several means.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>1) Cloning. Selected               troopers are sent to the various hidden Imperial clone labs where               specific material is taken from them for the express purpose of cloning               future Stormtroopers. Usually high intelligence, survivability, cunning,               efficiency, and loyalty are qualities considered.</p>
                <p>2) Conscription.               Most troopers are taken by this method, but not in the common sense.               From uncharted planets, in uncharted sectors, hundreds of thousands               of young candidates are raised for the express purpose of becoming               stormtroopers. On these planets, large colonies where established               long ago in order to raise children under proper ideological and corrective               conditions. These children are brought in from all over the universe               by circuitous routes and placed in dormitory style housing and raised               in a communal style and receive para-military training.</p>
                <p>3) Enlistment.               The least used, but the most publicized -- for that matter, the only               method that is publicized. Candidates are selected through rigorous               testing from military prep schools, penal correction centers, and            paramilitary youth groups.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>II. Shipment: Done             by circuitous routes to stormtrooper training planets.</p>
              <p>III. Indoctrination:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>1) Induction</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Mental. While               all trooper candidates are checked for loyalty before making it to               this stage, it is felt that additional persuasion and enhancement               is beneficial. Such being the case, propaganda, lectures, and activities               are conducted to further strengthen the trooper candidates' loyalty               to the Emperor and conviction in the Imperial cause (which is the               Emperor's cause).</li>
                  <li>Physical. It               has been found that when mental induction is combined with physical exertion (also known               as "breaking down") and wear on the spirit, conviction for                the Imperial               cause is increased.</li>
                  <li>Training: This is conducted in the most brutal               and efficient manner possible. Cadre are always elder stormtroopers               who are cut from field duty and assigned to "ride the trail" for a               period of five years.</li>
                  <li>Assignment to a training battalion.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>2) 1st week -Induction               and Indoctrination Training: This is just more of III above.</p>
                <p> 3) 2nd week -Instruction               in Rudimentary Military Skills (RMS).</p>
                <p>4) 3rd week -OPFOR:               Learning the Imperial enemy and it's threat to the Emperor's plan               for peace.</p>
                <p>5) 4th week -Instruction               in Rudimentary Combat Skills (RCS).</p>
                <p>6) 5th week -Practice               on the combat course.</p>
                <p>7) 6th and 7th               week -Repeat of 2nd week and continuation of 5th week.</p>
                <p>8) 8th and 9th               week -Instruction in Advanced Combat Skills (ACS).</p>
                <p>9) 10th week -Practice               on the combat course.</p>
                <p>10) 11th-14th               week -Instruction on All-Environmental Survival (AES).</p>
                <p>11) 15th week               -Taken to nearest combat zone for on-the-job combat experience.</p>
                <p>12) 16th week               -Survivors graduate and are shipped to advanced training.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>IV. Assignment to          advanced training:             This is determined by the following criteria.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>1) Skill. Trooper               candidates are shipped to training facilities where they are given               additional training in fields in which they show a tendency for excellence.</p>
                <p>2) Loyalty. Troopers               shown to have excessive zeal in serving the Emperor are referred to               a special school of the Imperial Stormtrooper Penetration Group. Here,               troopers receive reverse training, to remove all obvious presence               of having had Imperial military training. Troopers are then infiltrated               into known rebel groups as well as into the regular military forces               where they function as moles.</p>
                <p>3) Aptitude.            Troopers with an obvious aptitude for leadership are sent               on to Command School to receive further training and a commission               as senior enlisted or as a junior officers.</p>
